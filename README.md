# HR Analytics Dashboard 📊

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is an **HR Analytics Dashboard** built in Power BI to analyze employee attrition and workforce demographics.  
The aim is to help HR teams identify key factors influencing attrition and support data-driven decision-making.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Track **employee attrition rate** across multiple dimensions (Age, Salary, Education, Job Role, etc.)  
- Identify **patterns & risk areas** for employee turnover  
- Provide insights for HR to **improve retention strategies**

---

## 🔑 KPIs
- **Total Employees:** 1.47K  
- **Attrition Count:** 237 (16.1%)  
- **Average Employee Age:** 37 years  
- **Average Salary:** 6.5K  
- **Average Years at Company:** 7  

### Attrition Breakdown
- By **Education**: Highest from Life Sciences (37.55%) & Medical (26.58%)  
- By **Age Group**: Highest in 26–35 years (116 employees)  
- By **Salary Slab**: Mostly under 5K salary (163 employees)  
- By **Job Role**: Laboratory Technicians (62) & Sales Executives (57) show maximum attrition

🔎 Patterns & Risk Areas

1. Low Salary Bracket (< 5K):

Majority of attrition is from employees earning less than 5K.

Many of them leave within the first year of joining.

📌 Risk: Compensation dissatisfaction → high turnover in early tenure.

2. Age Group 25–35:

Highest attrition is in employees aged 26–35 years.

📌 Risk: This group is early–mid career and likely to switch jobs for better pay/roles.

3. Job Roles – Lab Technicians & Sales Executives:

These two roles show the highest attrition numbers.

📌 Risk: Possible reasons include workload, lack of career growth, or market demand for these skills.

💡 Recommendations for HR

1. Review Compensation Strategy:

Benchmark salaries against industry standards.

Introduce performance-based incentives for lower salary groups to improve satisfaction and retention.

2. Career Growth & Learning Opportunities:

Provide clear career paths, skill development programs, and mentorship, especially for 25–35 age group employees.

3 Targeted Retention Programs for High-Attrition Roles:

Conduct stay interviews with Lab Technicians & Sales Executives to understand challenges.

Offer role-specific perks (flexible schedules, professional certifications, sales incentives).
